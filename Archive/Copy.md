Founder’s Story

Utkarsh :

Hi, I’m Utkarsh Bhatia, the founder of Home Heros—a platform designed to make everyday life
easier by connecting people with trusted, skilled professionals for domestic services like cleaning,
cooking, pet care, gardening and more.

Before starting Home Heroes, I worked in the logistics sector at Amazon, where I learned firsthand
how efficiency, trust, and reliability can transform customer experiences. But at home, I noticed a
different story. Finding dependable help for basic household needs was surprisingly difficult—
unreliable schedules, inconsistent quality, and a lack of transparency made it a constant source of
stress.

In March 2025 while sipping coffee with my partners we were discussing about these services in a
very bigger picture and then, I made a decision that changed everything. I left my corporate job to
build something meaningful—something that could solve real problems for real people. That’s
when Home Heroes was born.

Our mission is simple: to bring order, reliability, and dignity to the domestic services industry. We
empower service providers with fair pay and consistent opportunities while giving busy families and
individuals peace of mind through a trusted, easy-to-use platform.

What started as a personal challenge became a bigger purpose—to help others manage their
homes with less hassle and more confidence. Today, Home Heroes is not just an app; it’s a growing
community built on care, commitment, and trust.

The idea for our business was born during a casual conversation with my co-partners at a local
Starbucks. We were sharing stories about our work experiences when I recalled a moment that had
stayed with me. While delivering packages one day, I noticed several elderly individuals tending to
their yard work and handling all their household chores on their own. This sparked a sense of
concern and curiosity in me. On one occasion, I approached an elderly couple and asked how they
managed everything by themselves. They shared that while sometimes friends or family lend a
hand, often, they are left to take care of everything on their own. That conversation resonated
deeply with me. I began to wonder—what if there was a way to ease their burden? What if someone
could step in to help with day-to-day tasks so they could focus on spending quality time with loved
ones, without the constant worry of household responsibilities? That moment was a turning point. I
saw a real need—an opportunity to support everyday Canadians, especially seniors and busy
families, in their daily lives. From that realization, the idea for our business was formed: a service-
oriented company dedicated to making life easier for those who need an extra hand. Our mission is
to provide reliable, compassionate, and personalized support, so people can focus on what truly
matters—time with family, health, and peace of mind.

Garima:

Hi! I’m one of the three co-founders of this app, and my journey here is a mix of learning, listening,
and a little bit of leap-of-faith. I started out with Amazon in India, spending nearly three years in
operations and catalog management. Later, I moved to Canada for my master’s and continued my
professional path with Amazon here too—this time gaining deeper experience in logistics and
customer-focused operations. In November 2024, I stepped away from the corporate world to
explore what’s next. Canada’s diversity and openness sparked so many ideas, and during that time,
a friend recommended Instacart for part-time income. I joined the platform and quickly became
fascinated with how simple yet impactful the model was. Then came the moment that sparked
everything. One day, I was delivering groceries to a young mom. She had a newborn in one arm, toys
scattered across the floor, laundry waiting in the corner—and despite it all, she greeted me with a
smile. As we chatted briefly, she said something that stayed with me: “Some days, I just wish
someone could come over, cook a simple meal, maybe fold the laundry, and give me a moment to
just breathe or enjoy time with my baby... and maybe let my husband rest too.” That stuck with me.
Later that week, over coffee with friends, I brought it up. And soon, we were talking about a much
bigger idea—not just cooking or cleaning, but how everyday families need a little extra help
sometimes. From someone to assemble furniture, run laundry, do a quick home manicure, to
preparing a fresh meal—what if all of these services were just a tap away? That simple thought
turned into brainstorming, planning, and eventually this app. Our goal? To create a platform that
connects real people with trusted, skilled individuals who can lend a hand—so parents can be
present, families can breathe a little easier, and skilled workers can earn by doing what they love.
